# python-satpass-gui
Python script to predict satellite passes using the orbit-predictor library and display them in a Tkinter GUI.

Structured using a Model-View-Controller pattern.

Satellites are configured in satellites.json. TLEs are retrieved from Celestrak, and the user's coordinates come from OpenStreetMap.
